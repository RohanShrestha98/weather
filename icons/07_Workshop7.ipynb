Then the parity of the packet remains unchanged, and the error goes undetected.  The parity method relies on the assumption that the likelihood of two errors in the same packet is really low.  If errors are frequent, then a small number of bits require a parity bit for error checking.  The more reliable a communication channel or a storage system is, the longer the data packets that can be used."

Not so with us humans.  When we type words or numbers, transposition errors are common.  So parity-type error detection does not work well when humans are involved.  For example, when a cashier gives up on the scanner that cannot read the UPC from a crumpled bag of chips, he enters it manually.  The cashier may mistype a digit or transpose two digits.  There must be a mechanism that detects such errors.  Such a mechanism uses checksums and check digits."

The sixth digit is the check digit: it is calculated as follows: we add up the first five digits, take the resulting sum modulo 10 (the remainder when the sum is divided by 10), and subtract that number from 10.  For example, if the first five digits of a driver’s license are 95873, the check digit is 10 - ((9 + 5 + 8 + 7 + 3) mod 10) = 10 - (32 mod 10) = 10 - 2 = 8.  So 958738 is a valid driver’s license number on Azkaban.  Note that if we add all six digits and take the result modulo 10, we get 0.  Does this system detect all single-digit substitution errors?
